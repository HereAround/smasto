sms-randminor \- manual page for sms-randminor 0.10.12
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sms-randminor
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIINPUT \fR[\fIOUTPUT\fR]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Extract a minor of the given input matrix (with dimensions specified.
by the '\-R' and '\-C' options), obtained by randomly selecting rows
and columns, and write it into OUTPUT.  Note that the minor rows and
columns are selected from the whole allowable range, not just the rows
and columns containing nonzero entries: therefore small minors have a
likely chance of being entirely null.
